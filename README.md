# HMM-ModE

Minor updates to the scripts from the papers below. The code was only available from the journal's supplementary materials. I have rehosted it here to include version control updates, currently without permission - but there's no license and all citations are below.

Updates include: removal of hard links, and compatibility with BLAST+.

The scripts still require HMMER v3.0 specifically, would ideally like to update this but have not had the time so far.
