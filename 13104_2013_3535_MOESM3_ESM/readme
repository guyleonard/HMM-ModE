1. Description of Perl Modules

Existing modules developed in house include Hmm3.pm, HMMmodE.pm were written in perl (5.10.1) and using BioPerl (1.6.901).
1. Hmm3.pm is used for fetching probabilities of amino acids from HMM profiles build from HMMER 3.0.
2. HMMmodE.pm is used for parsing MCL cluster output, modifying the emission probabilities and for cross-validation to generate discrimination thresholds using HMMER 3.0.

2. The Prerequisites

1. Dataset
A set of pre-classified sequences (An example dataset of AGC protein kinase family is provided as a test case, having 6 sub-families : grk58.seq, pkc69.seq, pka139.seq, pvpk50.seq, rac23.seq and s6pk41.seq)

2. Tools

BLAST  (can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/), we have used blast-2.2.22.
MCL - a cluster algorithm for graphs, must be installed with the option â€“enable-blast. (can be downloaded from http://micans.org/mcl/), we have used mcl-09-308.
Muscle for  sequence alignment (can be downloaded from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/#)
HMMER 3.0 -(can be downloaded from http://hmmer.janelia.org/)
Statistics::Lite module, for simple calculations (can be downloaded from CPAN)
Parallel::ForkManager (can be downloaded from CPAN)
Bio-Perl (can be downloaded from CPAN)


For the ease to use all compiled binaries are provided in the folder prerequisites at www.jnu.ac.in/Faculty/andrew which has following folders:

1. "bin", having all executables (compliled on linux x86_64 bit machine) and the Statistics::Lite and Parallel::ForkManager
2. BioPerl module are provided as separate folders. 
3. "test_data" which is an example dataset of AGC protein kinase family is provided as a test case, having 6 sub-families : grk58.seq, pkc69.seq, pka139.seq, pvpk50.seq, rac23.seq and s6pk41.seq

Now you have to simply export the environment variable as:

export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/path/to/BioPerl-1.6.901/:/path/to/BioPerl-Run-1.006900/
export PATH=/path/to/bin/directory/:$PATH


In addition you have to add the path of Hmm3.pm and HMMmodE.pm in the pre_processing.pl and hmmMode.pl scripts as
use lib '/path/to/directory_having_Hmm3.pm_and_HMMmodE.pm'


Samples scripts to run the protocol

1.Create a file containing list of all training sequence files
ls *seq >list (the files here have extension .seq)

2. Prepare a database of all training sequences as cat *.seq>all.fasta. This will be used to search the false positives.

3. Run pre_processing.pl, which requires list as an argument
   
   perl pre_processing.pl list

4. Run hmmmode.pl, which also requires list as an argument

   perl hmmmode.pl list


5. Run add_ga_threshold.pl, which writes the thresholds into the respective profiles. This program takes "list_cut.hmm" as the argument
which is generated during the previous script run.

   perl add_ga_threshold.pl list_cut.hmm

6 Now, you can use the HMM profiles generated in the "train_samples" directory to scan across the sequence database (of your choice, for example, you can use uniprot) using 'hmmsearch'. These searches are done using the --cut_ga option of 'hmmsearch' that report sequences >= this score threshold.
